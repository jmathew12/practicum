Dev Update
Scrum Note
    This week I worked on adding required validation for event data field when creating a new event for NSC events. It used to be that you could create an event without a date for the event. Now a date is required to create an event.

pull request review
    I was not able to do any pull request reviews this week
Including meetings with Biruk and working on the task and pull request, I spend about 20 hours this week. I did have a hard time following the tracks to figure out what code needs to be changed. Biruk helped me a lot.
